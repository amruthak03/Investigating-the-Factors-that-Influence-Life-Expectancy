# Global Life Expectancy Factor Analysis
## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the "Foundations of Machine Learning" course. The objective of this project was to explore the impact of various factors on life expectancy across the world using various techniques such as Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, one-way ANOVA, Simple Logistic Regression, and Multiple Logistic Regression. 

## Technologies/Tools Used
1. R Programming
2. RStudio
3. dplyr
4. glmnet
5. caret
6. coorplot
8. pROC

## Project Description
I addressed the following set of research questions in this project:
1. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
2. Is there a significant relationship between adult mortality rate and life expectancy?
3. How do various health indicators affect life expectancy?
4. Is there a significant difference in the mean life expectancy among different continents?
5. Is there an association between number of deaths of children under 5 years of age (per 1000 population) and the likelihood of having a longer life expectancy?
6. What is the relationship between a country's development status, adult mortality rate, and income composition of resources, and the likelihood of people having a longer life expectancy?

### Dataset Description
The dataset is taken from World Heath Organization (WHO) and includes information about life expectancy and associated variables from the year 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries. There are 22 variables and 2928 instances.
